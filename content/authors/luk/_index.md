    🛡️ Hi, I’m Luk. A passionate developer with a genuine and growing interest in offensive cybersecurity, malware analysis, networks, servers, intrusion, and automation.  

    .

    I am also the creator of this blog, a little corner for my notes and studies, Dragon Shell. The idea is for it to be a technical blog where I will be sharing and recording my studies and experiences in the ethical hacking world.  

    .

    Technologies:  

    💻 Java / Spring Boot  
    🐘 PHP / Laravel  
    🐧 Linux (bash scripts, automation)  
    🐍 Python (security tools)

    .

    Current Focus: 
    * Reconnaissance (OSINT).
    * Analysis and exploitation of vulnerabilities in systems.
    * Networks and web applications.
    * Penetration testing (pentest).
    * Security automation.
    * Studies on spoofing techniques.
    * (always guided by ethics and curiosity)
