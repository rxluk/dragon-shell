If you want to work with offensive security, system administration, web development, or simply understand how the internet really works, you need to master **network protocols**.

In this guide, we‚Äôll explore everything from protocol analyzers to DNS, covering TCP/IP, Ethernet, ARP, IP, TCP, UDP, and HTTP.

---

## üîç Protocol Analyzers

Protocol analyzers let you see and study the actual traffic flowing through the network. Tools like **Wireshark** and **tcpdump** display packets, headers, and data in real time.

### Examples:
```bash
sudo tcpdump -i eth0
sudo tcpdump -n host 8.8.8.8
```

In **Wireshark**, you can filter like this:
```
http
dns
tcp.port == 80
```

These tools are essential for forensics, troubleshooting, and security analysis.

## üåê Introduction to TCP/IP

**TCP/IP** is the foundation of internet communication. It organizes data transmission into layers:

1. **Application** ‚Äì protocols like HTTP, FTP, DNS  
2. **Transport** ‚Äì TCP, UDP  
3. **Internet** ‚Äì IP, ICMP, ARP  
4. **Link** ‚Äì Ethernet, Wi-Fi  

Each layer has specific roles and protocols to ensure standardized communication.

---

## üì° Network Protocols

Network protocols are standardized "languages" that machines use to communicate.  
Without them, every manufacturer would use their own method and nothing would work together.

---

## üñß Ethernet Protocol

**Ethernet** works at the link layer. It wraps IP packets into Ethernet frames, which include:

- **Source MAC address**
- **Destination MAC address**
- **Encapsulated protocol type**

### View MAC addresses:
```bash
ip link show
```

Ethernet is mostly used in LANs, cables, and switches.

---

## üß† ARP Protocol

**ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** maps an IP address to a MAC address.  
When a device wants to talk to another on the same network, it uses ARP to discover the MAC address.

### Show ARP table:
```bash
arp -a
ip neigh
```

### Common attack:
- **ARP Spoofing** ‚Äì sends fake ARP replies to intercept traffic (Man-in-the-Middle).

---

## üì¨ IP Protocol

**Internet Protocol** handles addressing and routing of packets.

- **IPv4**: 32-bit addresses (e.g., `192.168.0.1`)
- **IPv6**: 128-bit addresses (e.g., `2001:db8::1`)

### IPv4 address types:
- **Public**: reachable over the internet
- **Private**: used in local networks (`192.168.x.x`, `10.x.x.x`, `172.16.x.x` to `172.31.x.x`)

---

## üì¶ TCP Protocol

**Transmission Control Protocol** is **connection-oriented**.  
It ensures reliable data delivery, retransmits lost packets, and maintains order.

Key features:
- 3-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK)
- Flow control
- Acknowledgment (ACK)

### Check active TCP connections:
```bash
netstat -ant
ss -t
```

---

## ‚ö° UDP Protocol

**User Datagram Protocol** is **connectionless**.  
It does not guarantee delivery or order, but it‚Äôs much faster.

Used in:
- Video streaming
- Online gaming
- DNS
- VoIP

---

## üåê HTTP Protocol

**HyperText Transfer Protocol** is used for communication between browsers and web servers.

### Example HTTP request:
```
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

Today, we mostly use **HTTPS**, which adds encryption via TLS.

---

## üß≠ DNS ‚Äì Domain Name System

**DNS** converts names like `google.com` into IPs like `142.250.69.206`.

### Basic flow:
1. Browser asks the **local resolver** (usually your router).
2. If not cached, it queries **root servers**.
3. Root servers point to **TLD servers** (`.com`, `.org`, `.br`).
4. TLDs point to **authoritative servers** for the domain.
5. IP response returns to the client.

### Useful commands:
```bash
dig google.com
nslookup github.com
host openai.com
```

### Record types:
- **A**: points to IPv4 address
- **AAAA**: points to IPv6 address
- **MX**: mail server
- **CNAME**: alias
- **TXT**: texts, SPF/DKIM

---

## üîí Protocol Security

Some common vulnerabilities:
- **ARP Spoofing** ‚Äì poisons the ARP table.
- **DNS Spoofing/Poisoning** ‚Äì responds with fake IP.
- **Sniffing** ‚Äì captures unencrypted TCP/HTTP traffic.
- **Injection** ‚Äì exploits poorly configured protocols.

---

## üß™ Hands-on Practice

- Use **Wireshark** to observe real traffic.
- Capture a TCP handshake.
- Watch a DNS query in action.
- See how HTTP packets look without encryption.

Exploring protocols hands-on will cement your knowledge far more than just reading about them.

Understanding protocols is like speaking the internet's native language. It‚Äôs what separates someone who uses the network from someone who **masters** it.
